            <p>
                Nvidia GeForce Now is out right now and is available in two different tiers: Free and Founders. The Free plan is, you guessed it, free, and will allow users to play games in their existing PC game library for up to an hour at a time. There's another catch, too: Free users just have "standard access," this means that when the servers are feeling particularly congested - think launch conditions - you'll have to deal with a queue to play your games.

                <p>Video games have been around since the early 1970s. The first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space by Nutting Associates, was introduced in 1971. In 1972, Atari introduced Pong to the arcades. An interesting item to note is that Atari was formed by Nolan Bushnell, the man who developed Computer Space.

                        The idea for the Envavo Heatbuff came during a gaming session a cold winter night in Emil's basement in Denmark. <br>
                 
                       We quickly realized we were not the only ones with slow reaction time, less dexterity and discomfort because of cold hands while gaming. That is why we designed the Envavo Heabuff.</p>

               <p>t's not a surprise or a secret that companies creating new mobile gaming hardware are trying to replicate the design of the Nintendo Switch -- specifically its central screen and detachable paddlelike controllers.
                <br> Xiaomi's $600 Black Shark 2 Pro phone sorta-kinda falls into this category thanks to liquid cooling and a clip-on controller accessory.</p>
